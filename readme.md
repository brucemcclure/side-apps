#### Morning routine: https://github.com/hollyjc/sideproject

This application is ideal for parents (especially with young children), or people who struggle with time management. When you log into the app you select if you are getting ready by yourself, or if you also have children to get ready (if so - how many). You will then be asked what time you need to be at your destination, and how long it takes to get there. The application will then prompt you to check off what you (and your child/ren need if selected), such as: have a shower, do hair and make up, pack kidâ€™s lunches, dress the child, etc. The application will calculate the time it takes to do all of these tasks, and tell you what time you need to wake up to ensure you have enough time to do all of your activities and get to where you need to be on time.

## Jim Read

#### CookBookShopper: https://github.com/Jim-Read/CookBookShopper_sideapp1

The main purpose of this API/APP is to solve a common problem I have that comes up from time to time when I need to do food shopping but more or less to speed up/cure laziness when doing this mundane yet pretty frequent activity. The main purpose of the application is to store recipes. A user can create an account, create recipes, read them, edit them, delete them. These are user own creations and can be accessed anytime and anywhere, much like a recipe book. To build on this, the api will have features available to the user to be able to grab a list of their favourite ones - say the user picks 7 recipes - 1 dinner for each day of the week. The APP will return a condensed list of all ingredients the user needs to go buy.

#### SlashDotPizza: https://github.com/Jim-Read/SlashDotPizza_sideapp2

This API was designed with pizza in mind. Not every store is on uber eats etc, but most, if not all have a website, and being in Meblourne there is quite a lot of choice for pizza, quite spoilt for choice actually with every corner thinking they can make the best pizza in Melbourne. There is the mark ups and all that jazz on the popular delivery apps if you go that route. What this API aims to do is give access from a dump of all known pizza shops in Melbourne with their current menu/prices. The user will not be able to order through the application but merely give them information of what pizza is available - which shop is selling it and what else they have and price, where the shop is, link to their website and call them(might remove this but its aplace holder for now - as the user can techincally call the shop and place an order) Whilst the user can then rate it, comment on it, make friends and share their pizza finds with each other.

## Karim Tlais

## Logan Harris

#### Markdown to PDF converter: https://github.com/Magni0/AllInOneMD

To allow the upload, storage, editing, downloading and converting to pdf (with images) in one location to limit the need to use third party software when writing documentation in markdown files. When using third party websites to convert Markdown (MD) to pdf format it is inconveniant how few support the use of images and it can get messy with storage on a users device. This solution's pupose is to accumulate the diffrent aspects of documentaion into one conveiniant and easy to use method for a user.

#### Solar view: https://github.com/MichelleHM/Solar_Viewer

With more government and sustainability incentives, the installation and use of renewable energy sources such as solar have risen. Solar panels are one of the more accessbile systems which houses or other building structures may have installed to utilise solar radiation. The energy output of these solar panel systems may not be easily accessible to some people. This applciation aims to provide information to those who wish to view their or their community's energy output.

This application allows users to check the energy output of the solar panels in their geographical location. Providing live and forecasted energy outputs for a given location, users will have the option of checking their community's or their own solar panel's energy output.

## Mo Ahmad

#### kachow: https://github.com/mo-ccc/kachow

This project was created with the purpose to provide tech companies with an interface for managing and tracking the bugs within their projects. On login users will be presented with an overview dashboard.

From there users can use the console to access various pages. One of the pages will allow users to view/submit/manage bugs (mark them as closed or open). The other pages such as the calendar page will serve as a compliment allowing the users to see a calendar for when bugs were submitted and squashed. Users will be able to edit their profile information and are able to upload profile pictures to represent themselves.

The page where bugs are submitted will allow comments and collaboration between users and attachments are able to be submitted. Admins will be able to create new users and allocate them roles and teams. Users will be able to track their own performance and contributions from their personalised page.
