This application is ideal for parents (especially with young children), or people who struggle with time management. When you log into the app you select if you are getting ready by yourself, or if you also have children to get ready (if so - how many). You will then be asked what time you need to be at your destination, and how long it takes to get there. The application will then prompt you to check off what you (and your child/ren need if selected), such as: have a shower, do hair and make up, pack kidâ€™s lunches, dress the child, etc. The application will calculate the time it takes to do all of these tasks, and tell you what time you need to wake up to ensure you have enough time to do all of your activities and get to where you need to be on time.

## Jim Read

#### CookBookShopper: https://github.com/Jim-Read/CookBookShopper_sideapp1

The main purpose of this API/APP is to solve a common problem I have that comes up from time to time when I need to do food shopping but more or less to speed up/cure laziness when doing this mundane yet pretty frequent activity. The main purpose of the application is to store recipes. A user can create an account, create recipes, read them, edit them, delete them. These are user own creations and can be accessed anytime and anywhere, much like a recipe book. To build on this, the api will have features available to the user to be able to grab a list of their favourite ones - say the user picks 7 recipes - 1 dinner for each day of the week. The APP will return a condensed list of all ingredients the user needs to go buy.

#### SlashDotPizza: https://github.com/Jim-Read/SlashDotPizza_sideapp2

This API was designed with pizza in mind. Not every store is on uber eats etc, but most, if not all have a website, and being in Meblourne there is quite a lot of choice for pizza, quite spoilt for choice actually with every corner thinking they can make the best pizza in Melbourne. There is the mark ups and all that jazz on the popular delivery apps if you go that route. What this API aims to do is give access from a dump of all known pizza shops in Melbourne with their current menu/prices. The user will not be able to order through the application but merely give them information of what pizza is available - which shop is selling it and what else they have and price, where the shop is, link to their website and call them(might remove this but its aplace holder for now - as the user can techincally call the shop and place an order) Whilst the user can then rate it, comment on it, make friends and share their pizza finds with each other.

## Logan Harris

#### Markdown to PDF converter: https://github.com/Magni0/AllInOneMD

To allow the upload, storage, editing, downloading and converting to pdf (with images) in one location to limit the need to use third party software when writing documentation in markdown files. When using third party websites to convert Markdown (MD) to pdf format it is inconveniant how few support the use of images and it can get messy with storage on a users device. This solution's pupose is to accumulate the diffrent aspects of documentaion into one conveiniant and easy to use method for a user.

## Raymond Jewell

#### Diary: https://github.com/Rsjz11/diary

Idea of the Application: When creating this app I wanted to create an application that aided me in my ability to organise and collect my thoughts. Therefore, I created a diary application. I believed the decision to move away from pen and paper saves materials and works to ease the mind knowing you will not need to purchase a new one for the following year. The diary application will allow the user to create entries with dates attached, and enable user to edit their entries whether to improve or delete the contents. As an additional feature, I have added a history date API that provides an interesting historical date to the date of which the entry was created.

## Scott Malone

#### TradesmanAPP: https://github.com/ScottBurleighHeads/TradesmanAPP

This app has been established for clients to find tradies. There are many apps existing already where a client can get in touch with a tradesman. This app will be better because it is going to be more focused on tradies able to sell themselves. The current apps dont have a defined appproach where a client can determine if a tradesman is a quality tradesman or not. Clients often feel they gamble on who they get. There are currently star ratings that assist clients which is great but I feel that tradies can give more to the clients before starting work. This app will aim to be as professional as linkedin and as easy to navigate as gumtree. This app will focus on amplifying past achievements and completed Jobs through photos, references and personal input.
